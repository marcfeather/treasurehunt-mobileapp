Treasure Hunt Mobile Application

The /TreasureHunt directory contains the Treasure Hunt mobile application code.

The application can be launched from an Android Studio IDE, with the /TreasureHunt directory as a root directory and a virtual emulator.

While testing, it is recommended to use a 7 inch virtual emulator device with Google Play Services up to date.
